TYPESCRIPT:
- Typescript is a programming language developed and maintained by maintained by Microsoft.
- It is a strict syntactical superset of the JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

// HOW DOES TS CODE RUNS??
- TYPESCRIPT code never runs in your browser as your browser only understands JavaScript.
- JavaScript is a runtime language(the thing that actually runs in your browser / node.js runtime)
- Typescript is something that compiler down to JavaScript.
- When Typescript is transpiled down to JavaScript, you get type checking errors. If there is error converion to JS fails.
